      question: "What is AgriFAAS Connect?",
      answer: "AgriFAAS Connect is a comprehensive, cloud-based farm management platform designed for collaboration. It helps you and your team log and manage every aspect of your operationâ€”from land preparation and planting to harvesting and sales. It features real-time data synchronization, robust user management with specific roles, task management, inventory, budgeting, AI-powered advice, and specialized tools for Agric Extension Officers (AEOs)."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get an account?",
      answer: "To ensure data security and proper organization, new users are added by invitation only. An existing Administrator on a farm account must invite you using the 'User Management' dashboard. This process allows them to assign you the correct role (e.g., Manager, Farmer, AEO) before you even sign up."
    },
    {
        question: "I'm the first person from my farm. How do I register?",
        answer: "The very first user can register via the public 'Register' button on the homepage. This initial user is automatically assigned the 'Admin' role, giving them the ability to set up the farm and invite the rest of their team members."
    },
    {
      question: "How is my data stored and secured?",
      answer: "All your farm's data is stored centrally and securely in Firebase Firestore, a robust cloud database. This allows for real-time collaboration, meaning any update made by a team member is instantly visible to others. Access to data is controlled by multi-tenant security rules, ensuring that only authenticated members of your farm can access your information."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use AgriFAAS Connect on my mobile device?",
      answer: "Yes, AgriFAAS Connect is designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA). It's fully responsive and can be 'installed' on your smartphone or tablet's home screen for an app-like experience with offline access to cached assets."
    },
    {
        question: "What do the AEO (Agric Extension Officer) tools do?",
        answer: "The AEO module provides a dedicated dashboard for extension officers. It includes a 'Farmer Directory' which allows them to add new farmers, view detailed profiles of farmers they manage, and track farmer-specific information, challenges, and needs within their assigned region."
    },
    {
        question: "How does user management work?",
        answer: "Users with the 'Admin' role have access to a User Management dashboard. From there, they can view all users on the farm, manage their roles (e.g., promote a Farmer to a Manager), and invite new users by generating a secure, one-time registration link."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I get AI Planting Advice?",
        answer: "Navigate to the 'AI Advice' section from your dashboard. You'll need to provide details about your farm's weather data, soil conditions, and the crop you intend to plant. The system will then generate tailored advice using Google's AI models."
